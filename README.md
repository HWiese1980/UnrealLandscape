# UnrealLandscape
Landscape visualization from land cover maps generated by the [LCC.net](https://github.com/bneukom/LCC.net). The goal of this viualization is to show that low resultion global satellite imagery which is freely available can be used to improve landscape visualizations.

# Sample Scene
The project contains a sample scene with generated landcover maps from the Swiss Alps. Following a screenshot of this scene:

More can be seen at the bottom of this readme. By using the landcover maps we can drastically improve the visualization versus only using the low resolution satellite imagery as shown in the following screenshot:

# Landscape Material

The landscape material supports tree and grass placement using the landcover maps. Different models can obviously added if desired. The default material uses models from the Unreal sample projects. Different landcover types are simple blended together and can optionally also be blended partially with the satellite imagery to achieve higher fidelity. These parameters can be changed in the material instance.

# Workflow
To generate new scenes the steps described [here](https://github.com/bneukom/LCC.net) must be followed first. After following these steps we should have landcover maps for earch desired landcover type. The default material supports grass, rock, gravel, snow, water, tree, agriculture and builtup land cover types. If other landcover maps were generated using LCC the material has to be adapted accordingly.
